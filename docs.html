                        <li><strong>Initial Setup:</strong> In the "Overview" tab of Pyla Hub, select your map orientation, gamemode, and emulator. You can also change the mastery madness amount according to the current event boost in the Additional Settings tab. Once everything is configured, click the "Start" button.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Brawler Selection:</strong> Pyla Hub will launch another window called "PylaAI". This is where you'll select which brawler you want the bot to play. You can add multiple brawlers to form a queue - the bot will automatically switch to the next brawler once the current one reaches its target goal.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Enter Brawler Data:</strong> A new window called "Enter Brawler Data" will appear. Here you'll need to input:
                            <ul>
                                <li>What you want the bot to push (Trophies or Mastery)</li>

                        <li><strong>Access Brawl Stars:</strong> While the "Enter Brawler Data" window is open, switch to LDPlayer. If you haven't already, open the Play Store, sign in with your Google Account, and download Brawl Stars.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Check Brawler Stats:</strong> Open Brawl Stars and sign in with your Supercell account. Navigate to the brawler you want to push and check its current trophies, mastery, and win streak.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Complete Setup:</strong> Return to the "Enter Brawler Data" window and input the values you just checked. You can uncheck "Auto-pick Brawler in game" if you prefer to manually select your brawler instead of having the bot navigate to it automatically.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Configure Emulator Keys:</strong> Before starting the bot, you need to set up the keymapping in your emulator:

                <h2>Bot Info</h2>
                <p>This section provides detailed technical information about how Pyla AI works, by iyordanov.</p>
                
                <div class="bot-info-section">
                    <h3>Models</h3>
                    <p>Pyla AI uses several specialized AI models to perform different functions within the game. Below is an explanation of each model and how it was trained.</p>
                    
                    <div class="warning-box">
                        <strong>Note:</strong> The model documentation is based on the brawl-stars-bot repository.
                    </div>
                    
                    <h4>Specific in-game data</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Detects:</strong> 79 brawlers + 750 skins + each skin/brawler abilities + 5 types of balls + gems + power cubes + poison clouds + walls + bushes</li>
                        <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> 5.5/10</li>
                        <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Very high</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The assets were 107,395 images and the dataset was 100k images.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Why so much?</h4>
                    <p>Each brawler has around 40 angles from which you can see them, plus extra angles when shooting, and extra angles while moving and shooting. This quickly stacks up.</p>
                    
                    <h4>How did I manage to get all the assets:</h4>
                    <p>There are no assets for this online so I had to the following:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Code a script which goes into a game and makes screenshots of each angle of the brawler.</li>
                        <li>Train a model to crop out the brawler from the image</li>
                        <li>Train a model to segment the brawler out of the image</li>
                        <li>Get other in-game assets - Will skip this as it's just me manually going over every single map and becoming a Photoshop dev</li>
                        <li>Build a dataset generator with the assets</li>

                <h2>Goal</h2>
                <p>Understanding the purpose and motivation behind Pyla AI.</p>
                
                <div class="goal-section">
                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <p>The goal of Pyla AI is to help players progress faster before they quit the game due to low-level brawlers making them lose every game.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Progression Problem</h3>
                    <p>For those unfamiliar with Brawl Stars, here's the issue:</p>
                    <p>Each brawler has two primary stats: Health and Attack. The leveling system works as follows:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Level 1 → 9:</strong> 3,090 coins</li>
                        <li><strong>Level 9 → 11:</strong> 4,675 coins</li>
                        <li><strong>Level 7 unlocks gadgets:</strong> 1,000 × 2 coins</li>
                        <li><strong>Level 9 unlocks star powers and gears:</strong> 2,000 × 2 coins, 1,000 × 6 coins</li>
                        <li><strong>Level 11 unlocks hyper charges:</strong> 5,000 coins</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>To have a maxed account (all brawlers at level 11 with at least 1 star power, 1 gadget, and 2 gears), you need:</p>
                    <div class="highlight-stat">1,046,730 coins</div>
                    
                    <h3>Free-to-Play Progression</h3>
                    <p>An active free-to-play player will have the following monthly rewards:</p>
                    
                    <div class="progression-block">
                        <h4>3 Star Drops a Day</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Progression:</strong> Average 7,740 coins</li>
                            <li><strong>Time to complete:</strong> Average 12 hours</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="progression-block">
                        <h4>Complete Brawl Pass</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Progression:</strong> 8,000 coins</li>
                            <li><strong>Time to complete:</strong> 30 hours</li>

                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="progression-block">
                        <h4>Farm Mastery</h4>
                        <p>(Possible for 2 months and 6 days)</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Progression:</strong> 86,250 coins</li>
                            <li><strong>Time to complete:</strong> 120 hours</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>If a player spends roughly 35 hours a month planning perfectly what and how to play, and is at 56,700 trophies, they will gain:</p>
                    <p>(7740+8000)×1.2 + 1863 + [(86250/120) × 35] coins a month, which is:</p>
                    <div class="highlight-stat">20,751 + 25,156 (the first 2 months).</div>
                    
                    <h3>Time to Max Account</h3>
                    <div class="highlight-warning">
                        This means it would take <strong>4 YEARS</strong> for a free-to-play player to max their account.
                    </div>
                    
                    <h3>Motivation</h3>
                    <p>Pyla AI was created because the amount of grind is absurd. It takes 35 boring hours each month to grind, and then you can actually have fun. Many players don't have that kind of time. The only solution for busy people is to buy the Brawl Pass Plus, play 7 hours a month, and spend 3-4 hours on the last day completing quests.</p>

                        <li><strong>Graph</strong> - Diagram showing the code logic flow</li>

                        <li><strong>State manager</strong> - Automates actions based on the current game state</li>
                        <li><strong>Progress Observer</strong> - Keeps track of progress after each game to swap brawlers once specific goals are reached</li>
                        <li><strong>Lobby automator</strong> - Automates more complicated actions inside the lobby</li>
                        <li><strong>Detect</strong> - Transforms YOLOv8 output into an easier to use format</li>
                        <li><strong>Movement</strong> - Finds the best movement with the detected data</li>

                        <h4>State finder</h4>
                        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Identify the current game state</p>
                        <p><strong>Used in:</strong> State Manager</p>
                        <p><strong>How it works:</strong><br>
                        It uses template matching to compare parts of the screen to predefined images to identify specific game states. This method is quick and efficient because the lobby layout is static and rarely changes.</p>
                        <p>This is how the lobby looks after a game is over, and it hasn't changed in years. So we can find the state is 'end_game_lobby' by looking for the red thumbs down button.</p>

                        <h4>Time Management</h4>
                        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This class helps in determining whether specific time thresholds have been reached for various activities or states, ensuring that actions are taken at appropriate intervals.</p>
                        <p><strong>Used in:</strong> Main</p>
                        <p><strong>How it works:</strong><br>
                        It keeps a record of the last time each action happened and checks if enough time has passed to perform the action again. If the time threshold is met, it updates the record to the current time.</p>

                        <h4>Main</h4>
                        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The Main class is the core part of the application. It initializes all classes, loads the models, and controls how everything works together.</p>
                        <p>The bot plays brawlers in the order the user picked them. Once the wanted progression is reached, it will move to the next brawler.</p>

                        <h4>Screenshot Taker</h4>
                        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Return an image of the screen in PIL format</p>

                        <p><strong>How it works:</strong><br>
                        Initializes with a "camera" object from the "DXCam" library. Sometimes "DXCam" returns None images, which breaks the code. The take method ensures the image cannot be None.</p>
