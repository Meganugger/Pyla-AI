                <div class="devlog-content">
                    <p>We revisited the performance optimizations from March, as the compiled .exe version wasn't showing the same speed boosts we saw during testing.</p>
                    <p>It turns out the "new" screenshotting library was actually a step backward. By reverting to the previous library and combining it with parallel processing, we're seeing <strong>fantastic IPS again in the development environment</strong>. Now, the focus is on ensuring these gains translate to the final build.</p>

                <h2>Major Performance Boost & Multithreading</h2>
                <div class="devlog-content">
                    <p><strong>We achieved a significant performance breakthrough!</strong></p>
                    
                    <h3>+5-10 IPS Performance Increase</h3>
                    <p>By switching to a new Python screenshotting library, we saw a raw performance increase of <strong>12-52%</strong>, boosting IPS from ~30 to ~40 on our test systems. This change requires no extra setup for users.</p>

                    <h3>Up to 48 IPS with Multi-threading</h3>
                    <p>We further optimized by implementing <strong>multi-threading for screen capture</strong>. This resulted in a massive <strong>40-78% total increase in IPS</strong> compared to our previous stable version. This will be a game-changer, especially for users with powerful GPUs where screen capture was the bottleneck.</p>
                    
                    <p>The new build is heading to Early Access for feedback.</p>

                <h2>Breakthrough in Wall Detection Training</h2>
                <div class="devlog-content">
                    <p><strong>Huge progress on the wall detection AI!</strong> By training the model on datasets that include "fake players" (procedurally generated brawlers, health bars, and usernames), the AI is learning to identify walls even when they are partially obscured by characters.</p>
                    <p>This fixes a major issue where the bot would get stuck on walls it was standing too close to. Early training results are incredibly promising, and we're proud to say <strong>the bot can now correctly identify walls behind goalposts!</strong></p>

                    <p>To solve the problem of the bot not seeing walls when it's right next to them, we've been developing a <strong>"fake player generator."</strong> This script can create realistic-looking playersâ€”complete with brawler models, health/ammo bars, usernames, and icons (gadget, hypercharge, etc.)â€”and overlay them onto our training images.</p>
                    <p>This will create a robust dataset that teaches the AI to see walls no matter what's happening on screen.</p>

                    <p>We're building a <strong>new main menu</strong> to streamline the user experience. This menu will allow you to easily select game modes and access settings before heading to the brawler selection screen.</p>
                    <p>It will also expose more advanced settings, like "minimum movement delay," to give you more control over the bot's behavior. The aesthetics are still a work in progress, but the functionality is solid.</p>

                <h2>Refining the AI Training Data</h2>
                <div class="devlog-content">
                    <p>We identified and fixed two key issues that were preventing the AI from properly detecting metallic fences. We also improved our map generator to use consistent environments for each map, creating more realistic training data.</p>
                    <p>On another exciting note, we've received a folder with <strong>32,000 images of cut-out brawlers and skins</strong>, which will be invaluable for the next phase of training!</p>

                <div class="devlog-content">
                    <p>Our plan to improve the wall detection model has evolved. Instead of just using randomly generated maps, we are now <strong>extracting the actual map layouts directly from the game files</strong>.</p>
                    <p>By using these real layouts combined with our 17 different background environments, we can generate a massive, high-quality dataset of <strong>over 42,000 images</strong>. Early tests on a 30k image dataset show the model is getting much better at detecting individual bushes and complex tile formations.</p>

                <h2>Wall Detection: Implementation & Performance</h2>
                <div class="devlog-content">
                    <h3>Progress</h3>
                    <p>We've started implementing the new wall detection model into the bot's logic! In initial tests, the bot is already much better at avoiding shooting at walls. It can even be seen navigating around obstacles.</p>

                    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                    <p>Running two AI models (one for enemies, one for walls) simultaneously is resource-intensive and effectively halves the IPS (Iterations Per Second).</p>

                    <h3>The Solution</h3>
                    <p>We've implemented an intelligent <strong>"caching" system</strong>. You can set the wall detection to run less frequently (e.g., 10 times per second instead of 30), and the bot will "remember" the last known wall positions. This provides a huge performance save, bringing IPS back to near-normal levels with minimal impact on accuracy.</p>

                <h2>The Deep Dive into Wall Detection AI</h2>
                <div class="devlog-content">
                    <p>This period was a <strong>rollercoaster of intense development</strong> on our wall detection model.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Problem</h3>
                    <p>Manually labeling thousands of screenshots to train an AI is incredibly time-consuming.</p>

                    <h3>The Solution</h3>
                    <p>We built a custom <strong>"map maker" script</strong> that procedurally generates an almost infinite number of unique, labeled maps for training.</p>

                    <h3>The Breakthrough</h3>
                    <p>After many failed attempts and debugging a critical data labeling issue, we successfully trained a new <strong>YOLOv8 model</strong>. The results are phenomenal! On a small test dataset, the model is detecting walls, cacti, and barrels with high confidence.</p>
                    <p>This is the foundation for making the bot navigate maps intelligently. We are officially <strong>closer than ever to eliminating the issue of bots getting stuck on or shooting at walls</strong>.</p>

                <div class="devlog-content">
                    <p>Developer AngelFire has been hard at work adding new features for the next update:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Brawler-Specific Ranges</h3>
                    <p>Brawler attack and safe ranges have been implemented for more intelligent positioning.</p>

                    <h3>Manual Brawler Override</h3>
                    <p>A new option will let you disable auto-picking for a specific brawler, allowing you to quickly play with a manually selected character.</p>

                    <h3>GPU & Config Options</h3>
                    <p>The bot will now support <strong>GPU acceleration</strong> for users who want more performance. We're also adding more config options, like changing the detection frequency for walls, allowing users to balance performance and precision.</p>

                    <h3>Auto-Picking Complete</h3>
                    <p>The bot can now automatically select brawlers.</p>

                    <h3>No More Getting Stuck</h3>
                    <p>Thanks to a new state detection manager (credit to @AngelFire), the bot will no longer get stuck or time out during games.</p>

                    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                    <p>We are building a custom installer and refining the "play styles" feature. The bot is also being rewritten from scratch to address underlying bugs. Progress is looking good!</p>
